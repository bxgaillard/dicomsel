TODO LIST

Licence has to be defined.  If not GPL/LGPL, please refer to
src/images/README.txt for additional licencing information.  Once done, update
"head/licence.txt" and run "make head" to process the top of source files.

Everything is done.  Somehow, some improvements are possible:
    * add a toolbar (faster access than menu);
    * implement a slideshow-like presentation of the images;
    * preload the next image for better responsiveness;
    * more comments in *.cpp files and Doxygen comments in *.h files;
    * fix the image flickering effect.
