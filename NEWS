Change Log Summary


1.9.0 -- 2006-03-25 ----------------------------------------------------------

FIRST DEVELOPMENT MILESTONE OF VERSION 2.0
Future 2.0 pre-releases will be versioned as 1.9.x.

This development release introduces the DCMTK library integration.  It isn't
entirely done yet (most notably MSVC++ compatibility), but it should be
functionnal for UNIX-like systems.

* Added "3rdparty/dcmtk-3.5.4", generated with "tools/mkdcmtk.sh".
* Added "tools/mkdcmtk.sh" to make a simple DCMTK Autotools-compliant
  file hierarchy.


1.2.2 -- 2006-03-14 ----------------------------------------------------------

This release is a bugfix version.  It also introduces full compatibility with
the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.

* Bugfixes for GCC < 3.4 (assertions) and MSVC++ (some typo bugs).
* Updated "extra.mk".
* Support for MSVC++ through wine in extra.mk, now used by default since it
  produces much smaller executables.
* Updated "tools/gencom.sh" to handle "Makefile.msc" files.
* Updated "README" to reflect these changes.


1.2.1 -- 2006-03-03 ----------------------------------------------------------

This version, released on 3rd March 2006, has some minor bugs corrected.  Most
notably, resources files were never compiled.

* Resource files now compile under Windows.
* "dist" directory renamed to "bin".
* Autotools scripts moved from the main directory into "extra.mk".
* Some other changes to the "extra.mk" file.
* Changed the fake copyright sign by a real one in "/src/MainFrame.cpp".


1.2.0 -- 2006-03-02 ----------------------------------------------------------

This version was released on the 2nd March 2006.  The previous makefile system
has entirely been replaced by one based on the GNU Autotools.

* Replaced the former makefile system by GNU Autotools.
* Modified README to reflect this replacement (renamed from README.txt for the
  occasion).
* Corrected typo's in many files where "license" was incorrectly spelled.
* Moved include files (/src/*.h) into a dedicated directory
  (/include/dicomsel) to respect the IRCAD conventions about files location.
* Reversed the order of this log and renamed it to "NEWS".
* Added an empty ChangeLog file to make Automake happier.


1.1.0 -- 2005-08-?? ----------------------------------------------------------

This release was created during August 2005 to fix some bugs.  It is intended
to be integrated back to Radiofrequency soon.

* Corrected data format sent through IPC (char instead of wxChar).
* Introduced cross-compiling for Windows under Unix.
* Updated included wxWidgets version (2.6.0 -> 2.6.1).
* Moved wxWidgets precompiled libraries for Windows from "/wxwidgets" to
  "/3rdparty/wxmsw".
* Corrected a bug of program fault when another DICOM tree was loaded right
      after viewing an image.
* Corrected locale-related bugs for floating point to string conversion and
  vice-versa by using "std::setlocale()".
* Removed MSLU dependency on Windows by using a non-unicode wxWidgets build
  and updated README.txt accordingly.
* Slightly reworked "rfsample" user interface.
* Disabled exception handling in wxWidgets build (useless since exceptions are
  handled outside wxWidgets) to recude executable size by about 30% (!).
* Fixes for image reading on big endian machines.
* Actually, image flickering still occuring under Windows. Any idea?


1.0.9 -- 2005-07-?? ----------------------------------------------------------

This release is the software integrated to the Radiofrequency project during
June 2005.

* Implemented IPC for integration with Radiofrequency.
* Corrected the image flickering effect when resizing (theorically).
* Corrected some minor bugs (cosmetics, typos, UI tuning...).


1.0.0 -- 2005-06-?? ----------------------------------------------------------

This release is the final version used for the project presentation.
* First release.
