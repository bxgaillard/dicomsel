1.2.0 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

This version was released on the 2nd March 2006.  The previous makefile system
has entirely been replaced by one based on the GNU Autotools.

* Replaced the former makefile system by GNU Autotools.
* Modified README to reflect this replacement (renamed from README.txt for the
  occasion).
* Corrected typo's in many files where "license" was incorrectly spelled.
* Moved include files (/src/*.h) into a dedicated directory
  (/include/dicomsel) to respect the IRCAD conventions about files location.

* Added an empty ChangeLog file to make Automake happier.


1.1.0 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

This release was created during August 2005 to fix some bugs.  It is intended
to be integrated back to Radiofrequency soon.

* Corrected data format sent through IPC (char instead of wxChar).
* Introduced cross-compiling for Windows under Unix.
* Updated included wxWidgets version (2.6.0 -> 2.6.1).
* Moved wxWidgets precompiled libraries for Windows from "/wxwidgets" to
  "/3rdparty/wxmsw".
* Corrected a bug of program fault when another DICOM tree was loaded right
      after viewing an image.
* Corrected locale-related bugs for floating point to string conversion and
  vice-versa by using "std::setlocale()".
* Removed MSLU dependency on Windows by using a non-unicode wxWidgets build
  and updated README.txt accordingly.
* Slightly reworked "rfsample" user interface.
* Disabled exception handling in wxWidgets build (useless since exceptions are
  handled outside wxWidgets) to recude executable size by about 30% (!).
* Fixes for image reading on big endian machines.
* Actually, image flickering still occuring under Windows. Any idea?


1.0.9 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
