Corrections and improvements made to libdicom during DicomSel development:

* Class member initialization order correction (caused GCC warnings).
* Headers location (<dicom/xxx> instead of <xxx>)
* Some corrections in directory parsing under non-Win32 platforms.
* More tolerant code in file reader, allows scanning a directory with
  different file types (not only DICOM ones).
* Some other minor corrections.
