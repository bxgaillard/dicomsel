Corrections and improvements made to libdicom during DicomSel development:

* Class member initialization order correction (caused GCC warnings).
* Headers location (<dicom/xxx> instead of <xxx>)
* Some corrections in directory parsing under non-Win32 platforms.
* More tolerant code in file reader, allows scanning a directory with
  different file types (not only DICOM ones).
* Preprocessor conditionals using WIN32 were replaced by ones using _WIN32,
  which is far more portable accross compilers.
* DLL-specific macros (DicomLib_API) in DicomLib.h and ExceptionDicom.h have
  been commented out to let the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler build a static
  library.
* Missing "#include <cassert>" (which caused compilation failures with legacy
  GCC versions < 3.4) have been added.
* Compatibility fix for GCC 4.1: removed class name in methods declaration
  ("class x { int x::f(void); };" -> "class x { int f(void); };").
* Some other minor corrections.
