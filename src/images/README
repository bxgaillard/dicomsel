/src/images

This directory contains the icon of the application and the images used in the
tree view.

"icon.ico" and "icon.xpm" are the icon of the application.  They are original
artwork created for this purpose and are licensed under the same terms as the
application itself.
"dir.xpm", "image.xpm", "patient.xpm", "series.xpm" and "study.xpm" come from
KDE, and so fall under the GNU General Public License.  If the application is
to be released under another license than the GPL, these must be removed or
replaced with other icons.
