/head

This directory contains files which will be included in each source file head.
They are used by the "gencom.sh" script in the "tools" directory.

Once the license is defined, update "license.txt" ("license-gpl.txt" is an
example, use it if the GPL has been chosen) and run "make -f extra.mk head" in
the top directory (the directory parent to this one).
