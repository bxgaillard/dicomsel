/head

This directory contains files which will be included in each source file head.
They are used by the "gencom.sh" script in the "tools" directory.

Once the licence is defined, update "licence.txt" ("licence-gpl.txt" is an
example, use it if the GPL has been chosen) and run "make head" in the top
directory (the directory parent to this one).
